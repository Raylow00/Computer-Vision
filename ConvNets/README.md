Convolutional Neural Networks:

This is a repo to all beginner-friendly convolutional neural networks for different use cases, mainly image tasks. Although these are mainly for reference purpose, the notebooks can be downloaded to run in Google Colab.

How to use:
1. Download the notebook.
2. Upload notebook to your Google Drive to utilize Google Colab that provides a free GPU.
3. Connect to a hosted runtime to start using their GPU.
4. Go to "Edit -> Notebook settings" and change "Hardware Accelerator" to GPU.
5. Start by running each cell to see the results.
