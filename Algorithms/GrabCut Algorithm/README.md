# Computer-Vision-GrabCut-Algorithm
An introduction to an image segmentation algorithm mostly used in Computer Vision - GrabCut

This is an brief introduction code for the algorithm GrabCut using OpenCV. A more detailed algorithm explanation can be found on my Medium post (link in my profile).

The result is an image with only the foreground segmented from the background. 

What I Learnt:
- How GrabCut algorithm works
- How to implement GrabCut using OpenCV

Future Implementation:
- Working on having object detection and image segmentation algorithms(including Watershed algorithm) to extract written words from pictures taken from a smartphone camera.
